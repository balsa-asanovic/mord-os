# Project overview
#### Functional requirements:
The client requested for a graphical user interface for a web based operating system. Considering that this is an MVP, functionality is supposed to be far from an OS but it does need to **look and feel like an OS**, to be **appealing and fun to explore**. Borgoth, **being the imaginary flaming venture demon**, should be this operating system's brand.  
Client also requested functionalities that they thought might bring a lot of value, such as:
- Mord OS should support creating and managing plain text files and include a directory mechanic in
  order to sort the files as one wishes.
- There should be a simple authentication feature so not everyone can access the OS. A simple email
  and password flow will do for now. ( *email: borgoth@mordos.com / pass: 12bindthem*)

Other functionalities that are not as crucial but could really help enrich the OS:
- To keep up with all the news and banter going on, the OS could include a dedicated **RSS reader app**. (data source: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments)
- Having a **Camera app** seems like a must for any OS today.
- It would be good if the OS had a **Gallery app** to view images from different sources without having to switch. (data source: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos , but can include others)
- The OS could also have a **dedicated web browser**. Can be simple at first.

#### Visual requirements 
Creative freedom given as long as the following visual requirements are respected: 
- The OS should look familiar to other systems so it doesnâ€™t create confusion. 
- No visual UI libraries should be used.
- Keep it sane 	:exploding_head:
